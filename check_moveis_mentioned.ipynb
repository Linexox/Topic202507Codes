Through the shell of the sad story, the audience gets the director's deeper thinking and understanding of the human nature of life.Focusing on the spiritual core of saving and being saved, the narrative unfolds, the theme is expounded, and the blindness to reality is unveiled. The audience is touched and awakened. The director fully played the magic of the movie, disrupting the narrative time and space, intersecting the past and the present, and advancing freely following the protagonists’ emotions, making the story structure more tense and the theme and emotions more heartfelt. Although it describes the underworld, the director deliberately avoided the violence rendering and used extremely life-like methods to describe the underworld story routines such as gang struggle and group fight.\"] [3] Then don't miss her movie Failan. It shows a love tragedy in which the two people are secluded in different time spaces. However, the movie doesn't just tell a sad but beautiful love story. Through the story, the audiences can see the director's profound thinking and understanding of life and human nature.\n",
