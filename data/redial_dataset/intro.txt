Dataset Composition
Structure
The dataset is published in the “jsonl” format, i.e., as a text file where each line corresponds to a Dialogue given as a valid JSON document.

A Dialogue contains these fields:

conversationId:         an integer
initiatorWorkerId:      an integer identifying to the worker initiating the conversation (the recommendation seeker)
respondentWorkerId:     an integer identifying the worker responding to the initiator (the recommender)
messages:               a list of Message objects
movieMentions:          a dict mapping movie IDs mentioned in this dialogue to movie names
initiatorQuestions:     a dictionary mapping movie IDs to the labels supplied by the initiator. Each label is a bool corresponding to whether the initiator has said he saw the movie, liked it, or suggested it.
respondentQuestions:    a dictionary mapping movie IDs to the labels supplied by the respondent. Each label is a bool corresponding to whether the initiator has said he saw the movie, liked it, or suggested it.

Each Message contains these fields:

messageId:          a unique ID for this message
text:               a string with the actual message. The string may contain a token starting with @ followed by an integer. This is a movie ID which can be looked up in the movieMentions field of the Dialogue object.
timeOffset:         time since start of dialogue in seconds
senderWorkerId:     the ID of the worker sending the message, either initiatorWorkerId or respondentWorkerId.

The labels in initiatorQuestions and respondentQuestions have the following meaning:

suggested:  0 if it was mentioned by the seeker, 1 if it was a suggestion from the recommender
seen:       0 if the seeker has not seen the movie, 1 if they have seen it, 2 if they did not say
liked:      0 if the seeker did not like the movie, 1 if they liked it, 2 if they did not say
